# MERN Stack Technical Quiz app

🏗 This is a MERN Stack app to solve different quizes. You can create an account and login to start solving technical quizzes in different topics.

I've used:
- React.js on client side
- Tailwindcss to style
- MongoDB as a database
- Node.js / Express to write REST API to communicate with database and User authentication
